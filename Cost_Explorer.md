To optimize the cost of your deployed infrastructure in AWS and ensure it's both cost-effective and performant, you can follow a structured approach using AWS services and best practices. 

# Using AWS Cost Explorer to analyze costs.
Key steps:
* Accessing AWS Cost Explorer: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Billing and Cost Management and select Cost Explorer.
* Choosing time periods: Select the time period you want to analyze (e.g., last month, last quarter, or custom ranges).
* Grouping costs: Group the costs by service, linked account, region, tags or usage type to get a detailed understanding of where the money is going.
* Identifying cost spikes: Look for services that have sudden increases in usage and costs, and investigate the cause.
* Analyzing cost trends: Review the historical trends in cost to identify any seasonal patterns or significant changes.

# Identifying underutilized resources and suggesting rightsizing opportunities.

Key tools for rightsizing:
* AWS Trusted Advisor: Trusted Advisor is a tool that provides real-time recommendations to help you follow AWS best practices. It checks for underutilized EC2 instances, idle load balancers, unassociated Elastic IPs, and more.

Actions:

* Review the "Cost Optimization" category in Trusted Advisor for recommendations related to underutilized EC2 instances, unused EBS volumes, and idle load balancers.
* AWS Compute Optimizer: This tool analyzes your EC2 instances and provides recommendations on which instances could be downsized or switched to a different instance type (e.g., from t2.large to t3.medium).

Actions:

* Identify EC2 instances that are underutilized (low CPU or memory usage).
* Compute Optimizer will recommend a new instance type that may be more cost-efficient while maintaining similar performance.

# Exploring Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans to achieve cost savings.

Actions:

* Check if you have any EC2 instances running at a consistent level of usage.
* Purchase Reserved Instances for those instance types, with no upfront (monthly) or partial/full upfront payment, depending on your budget.

Example:

* If you have several t3.large EC2 instances running 24/7, purchasing Reserved Instances for those instance types could save up to 50% compared to on-demand pricing.
